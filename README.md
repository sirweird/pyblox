# PyBlox

### What is PyBlox?
PyBlox is a desktop application developed to make coding easy and fun. It's a block-based coding environment that is very similar to Scratch. It is currently being developed using the Python programming language. Unlike Scratch, you aren't limited to making games with PyBlox. Our library allows PyBlox users to install Python libraries and use them to make programs with PyBlox like:  
  
**• Advanced math equations with NumPy**  
**• Creative GUIs with Tkinter or PyQt5**  
**• A Discord bot with the Discord Python API**  
**• Much more!**  

While you're creating a project, you will have the ability to test it and the code will run using Python, but once you've finished a project, you'll have the choice of exporting it as an executable, but you could also get the Python source code and even edit the code using a code editor.

### How do I download it?
Well, we're still in development, but there is an alpha version that should be available on the website.
